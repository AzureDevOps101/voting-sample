# Example Voting App

## Getting started

Download [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/overview). If you are on Mac or Windows, [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) will be automatically installed. On Linux, make sure you have the latest version of [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Run in this directory:

```shell
docker-compose up
```

The app will be running at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000), and the results will be at [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001).

Alternately, if you want to run it on a [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/), first make sure you have a swarm. If you don't, run:

```shell
docker swarm init
```

Once you have your swarm, in this directory run:

```shell
docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-stack.yml vote
```

## Architecture

![Architecture diagram](architecture.png)

* A Python webapp which lets you vote between two options
* A Redis queue which collects new votes
* A .NET worker which consumes votes and stores them inâ€¦
* A Postgres database backed by a Docker volume
* A Node.js webapp which shows the results of the voting in real time

## Deploy to Kubernetes

Note: if you are attending leansoftX.com hosted training sessions, <acr-passowrd> will be provided by the trainer. Otherwise you will need to replace all azuredevops101.azurecr.cn reference to your own ACR instance.

```shell
# create a secret according to your Azure Container Registry settings
kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred --docker-server=azuredevops101.azurecr.cn --docker-username=azuredevops101 --docker-password=<acr-password> --docker-email=info@leansoftX.com

# run kubectl to deploy
cd kompose
kubectl apply -f ./
```

## Note

The voting application only accepts one vote per client. It does not register votes if a vote has already been submitted from a client.
